#Simple Modular and Test Patterns

##Description:
I am creating a simple Javascript object that will be exported using the Node module pattern. The object has a function named 'greet' that takes a name as a parameter and returns the string 'hello ' + name

Its test verifies the output of the function.

##Bonus:
For the extra point, I created a command line utility that will be run using node greet.js 'some name' and will pass the input contained in that argument to the greet function and output the result to the screen.

For a second bonus point, I wrote a test that makes sure that the arguments are being processed.
